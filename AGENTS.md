- Use TypeScript whenever possible
- Prefer using Deno's standard library rather than third-party libraries
- Use Deno as the TypeScript runtime
- The browser extension in browser_ext/ is a universal extension with polyfills
- Be sure to run `deno fmt` and ensure `deno lint` passes and `deno check`
  passes before finishing changes
